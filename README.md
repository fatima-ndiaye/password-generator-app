## Overview
### Description
This password generator is a simple yet powerful tool to help you create strong, random passwords. It is built using vanilla JavaScript, which means it does not require any additional frameworks or libraries. The generator allows you to choose the length of your password between 5 and 20 characters and generates two different password options for you to choose from. You can easily copy the password of your choice by clicking on it.

The generator also includes a feature that ensures that the passwords generated are random and unique, it uses a combination of letters, numbers and special characters to create the password. This makes the passwords generated by the generator much stronger than regular human generated passwords which are prone to be guessable.

The user interface is simple and easy to use, making it accessible to users of all skill levels. Whether you need a password for a personal account or for a work-related one, this password generator can help you create a secure and unique password in just a few seconds.
